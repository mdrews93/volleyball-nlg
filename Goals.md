Include high-level goals for each semester/year. These should include major milestones like "submit paper to X venue," "complete implementation of Y", "finish collecting data Z," etc.

## 2018
Note: Once we've discussed my ideas and I've chosen a particular project, I will update this with more detailed goals
* Complete the implementation of the project
* Develop a user-friendly interface for reproducing the results or running the program on new data (Eg. generating a new volleyball match summary)
* If the project involves significant and novel algorithm implementations, consider writing and publishing a paper.
